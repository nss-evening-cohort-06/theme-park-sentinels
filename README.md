1. At root: `firebase init`. Selecting 'hosting', select 'correct Firebase project'. THEN YES TO ALL THE THINGS! (Once per project).
1. Update [Gruntfile.js](https://gist.github.com/morecallan/732a2923b18c99c14ffd8d9838bf3410#file-5_deploy_gruntfile-js)
1. Add any files you want to be in your 'public' (hosted) project to the 'copy .. / .. src' array.
1. Inside 'lib': `grunt deploy` (this creates 'public' folder at the root).
1. At root: `firebase deploy`.

### When Actively Making Changes
1. Run `grunt cleanit` to ðŸ’¥DESTROYðŸ’¥ the public folder. If you don't do this, running http-server won't reflect your changes.

## How This Project Works
1. Search: When a user enters text into the search field, the areas which contain the searched text are outlined in red.

2. When a user clicks on one of the colored areas, the attractions located in the selected area are shown on the left side of the page. If an attraction is closed or under maintenance, it will not appear.

3. When a user selects an attraction showing on the left side, a description of the attraction will expand below the attraction name.  If applicable, event times will also be shown here.
